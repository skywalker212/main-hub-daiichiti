# main-hub-daiichiti

    Source and Scripts for the master Apex DC++ hub of DAIIChiTi. 

## history

Back in the good ol' days when DAIIChiTi was worth something, I was the Apex DC++ Main hub operator for the Main Hub of DAIIChiTi for quite some time where people used to share things, which they collected through some efforts. 'Twas a very good feelin when somebody was downloading your stuff and that fueled the desire to collect more content and give it to community. This scripts are written by the veterans and have been passed down to the operators for generations. Every operator added a touch of 'em in the scripts and modified the scripts in some way or another. I also played my part and understood the ptokax API and wrote/modified the scripts on my own in the summer vacation but the main hub was bound to be doomed. I also implemented a filter to ban the users for some time when they searched for porn/offensive stuff on the hub, I wanted to closely monitor those individuals and apprehend 'em. On a hot summer afternoon, we received mail that some student complained about the porn being shared on the main hub and the big brother(s) decided to ban the main hub once in for all. All that we achieved, the legends, the myths, the glory, all was lost in a bad decision. Of course my fellow DC users moved on, it wasn't a big deal for them. On the other side, I was really heart broken, being a DC HUB master was an honor. Seeing the fall of DC under my watch was the worst experiences of my life, it's like you are given a custody of a sweet child but despite of all the efforts that you put through, they take the child away. 

## reason

I know there are still people who want to take to baton. This is for learning purpose only, it is for you to host your own main hub in your private network and relive the legacy.
